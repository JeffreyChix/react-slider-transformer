Using npm: `npm install react-sliderify`

### Usage

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Sliderify from "react-sliderify";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <div className="home-page">
      <Sliderify>
        <div
          style={{ height: "500px", backgroundColor: "red", color: "white" }}
        >
          Slide 1
        </div>
        <div
          style={{ height: "500px", backgroundColor: "green", color: "white" }}
        >
          Slide 2
        </div>
        <div
          style={{ height: "500px", backgroundColor: "blue", color: "white" }}
        >
          Slide 3
        </div>
      </Sliderify>
    </div>
  );
};

// Note: you have the option to enhance the presentation by supplying an array of objects to the 'slides' property. Each object must contain a 'content' property, representing the slide content in the form of a JSX element. The 'title' property is optional and can be used to provide a descriptive heading for the slide.
